This data field calculates at which point the catcher car is going to catch you based on your average speed. For instance, if you ran 10 kilometers in 60 minutes, your average speed is 10 kph, and if you proceed with this pace, the catcher car will catch you at the 15th kilometer in 30 minutes. In this case, the data field will show you "0:30:00" as the remaining time, "15.00" as finish, your runner icon will be at the 2/3 of the screen and the catcher car icon at the 1/3 of the screen. At some point you will see also how far is the catcher car from you
